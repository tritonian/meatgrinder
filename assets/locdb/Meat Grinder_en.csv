2,,,Mod description.,,,"The meat grinder requires a sacrifice. Will you be able to stay away from the chopping block? \n\nThe player with the fewest kills is eliminated every set amount of time. Recommend 10/4 timer with double vils, point reset, smaller maps, and FFA. \n\nIf you run across any issues or have suggestions please contact me, you can find me on discord, Rasselbock. \n\nCredit to KillerPigeon for the idea and many thanks to Zlatý Bludišťak (sorry your username caused publish issues like you talk about smh) and FoxDie for letting me copy their homework."
